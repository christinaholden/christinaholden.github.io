					<p>Building my portfolio was a chance to showcase my skills and design personality.</p>
					<p>I wanted a simple, yet interesting site that, like a resume, kept relevant information up front. However, I also wanted each case study to have its own space. In this way, each case study could be presented with its own design elements that suited it, rather than conform to that of the front page.</p>
					<p>The portfolio needed to conform to conventional expectations, but it also needed set my work apart and present a personality of its own.</p>
					<figure class="figure text-center py-4">
						<img class="img-fluid border border-white" src="images/mood-board.jpg" alt="A mood board developed for my portfolio.">
						<figcaption class="figure-caption text-left text-white">A mood board developed for my portfolio.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Thinking about how I wanted to present my work, I created a mood board with images and colors that appealed to me. From these images, I created a color pallet and developed a general vision of the finished product.</p>
					<figure class="figure text-center py-4">
						<img class="img-fluid border border-white" src="images/wireframes.jpg" alt="Wireframe designs for my portfolio.">
						<figcaption class="figure-caption text-left text-white">Wireframe designs developed for my portfolio.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>I researched other profiles to determine what information would be expected by prospective clients, making note of common conventions.</p>
					<p>Then, working mobile first, I laid out the main page, dividing each section by purpose and color, and keeping all links to each section visible.</p>
					<p>When writing the content, I kept the amount of information short and precise. I wanted the user to be able to peruse the whole project quickly. I also avoided too much animation to maintain the site's focus on functionality.</p>
					<figure class="figure text-center py-4">
						<img class="img-fluid border border-white" src="images/logo-sketches.jpg" alt="Sketch designs for logo.">
						<figcaption class="figure-caption text-left text-white">Sketch designs for logo.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>The logo is my own design, derived from my initials. I wanted something that looked painted, to reflect the concepts of creativity and design. I also chose my cover image with these themes in mind, then adjusted the color pallet slightly to match the pallet in the image.</p>
					<p>The finished product fills the requirements I laid out for it. It works well across all the devices I have managed to test it on, and plays well with Github Pages. The case study pages can easily be switched out for new ones, which was an important feature of the site's structure. In the future, I would like to replace the stock image I used for the cover image with one of my own design, as I feel that would further extend the portfolio's unique personality.</p>
